Project Description:
Trailicious allows a Delicious user to view a trail from one of his 'Friends' (the people he follows on Delicious). Once the user logs into the Trailicious site, he selects a friend from the Friends list. Next, he selects a trail from the Trails list. We have filtered the selected friend's tags to only display those tags that begin with 'trail:'. Next, the 'Other Tags' list is populated with any other tags that are associated with the bookmarks in the selected trail. The Links list is populated with the bookmarks from the selected trail. The user can modify the new trail by either filtering by Other Tags or by removing an individual bookmark. Additionally, the user can add his own tags by drag-and-drop with the tags that appear in the 'My Tags' list. The user can also create a new tag by clicking on the green plus button and then adding it to a bookmark. Once the new trail is ready to be saved to Delicious, the user can click on the 'Post Trail to Delicious' button.
